This is the english explaination of the work that is pushed.

edit 6/20/2022:
Naming conventions on the HTML and CSS files are not absolute and will change 
upon the final debugging process. The names are simply for myself at the moment. 
Thank you for understanding on the rough file, it will become user friendly as 
I am still working on good work practices. This is a lesson I have learned already;
good naming conventions at the beginning help with troubleshooting later on.
